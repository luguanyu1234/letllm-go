# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The LLM API Route Proxy Server is a unified gateway that provides a standardized interface for multiple Large Language Model (LLM) providers. The system acts as a proxy layer that routes requests to different LLM providers (OpenAI, Google Gemini, etc.) while providing features like load balancing, rate limiting, authentication, and response transformation. This enables applications to interact with multiple LLM providers through a single, consistent API interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to send requests to multiple LLM providers through a single API endpoint, so that I can easily switch between providers without changing my application code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client sends a request to the proxy server THEN the system SHALL route the request to the appropriate LLM provider based on configuration
2. WHEN the proxy receives a response from an LLM provider THEN the system SHALL transform the response to a standardized format
3. WHEN multiple providers are configured THEN the system SHALL support routing based on provider preference or load balancing rules
4. IF a provider is unavailable THEN the system SHALL attempt failover to an alternative provider when configured

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure multiple LLM providers with their respective API keys and settings, so that the proxy can authenticate and communicate with each service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL load provider configurations from a YAML configuration file
2. WHEN a provider configuration includes API keys THEN the system SHALL securely store and use them for authentication
3. WHEN provider settings are updated THEN the system SHALL support hot-reloading of configuration without restart
4. IF configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL log detailed error messages and fail gracefully

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the proxy to handle rate limiting and request throttling, so that I don't exceed provider API limits and incur additional costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requests exceed configured rate limits THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP 429 status codes
2. WHEN rate limits are approaching THEN the system SHALL implement backoff strategies
3. WHEN different providers have different rate limits THEN the system SHALL enforce provider-specific limits
4. IF rate limiting is configured THEN the system SHALL track and reset limits based on time windows

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want the proxy to authenticate incoming requests, so that only authorized clients can access the LLM services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a request is received THEN the system SHALL validate the provided authentication token
2. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 401 Unauthorized status
3. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL allow the request to proceed to the LLM provider
4. IF no authentication is configured THEN the system SHALL optionally allow unauthenticated access based on configuration

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities, so that I can track usage, debug issues, and monitor system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requests are processed THEN the system SHALL log request details, response times, and provider used
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information with appropriate log levels
3. WHEN the system is running THEN it SHALL expose health check endpoints for monitoring
4. IF metrics collection is enabled THEN the system SHALL track and expose performance metrics

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the proxy to support streaming responses, so that I can provide real-time LLM outputs to end users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a streaming request is made THEN the system SHALL establish a streaming connection to the appropriate provider
2. WHEN streaming data is received THEN the system SHALL forward it to the client in real-time
3. WHEN streaming connections are interrupted THEN the system SHALL handle reconnection gracefully
4. IF streaming is not supported by a provider THEN the system SHALL fall back to non-streaming responses

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a cost-conscious developer, I want request and response caching capabilities, so that I can reduce API costs for repeated queries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN identical requests are made within the cache TTL THEN the system SHALL return cached responses
2. WHEN cache storage limits are reached THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate eviction policies
3. WHEN responses are cached THEN the system SHALL respect cache headers and TTL settings
4. IF caching is disabled THEN the system SHALL bypass cache and forward all requests to providers

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the proxy to transform requests and responses between different provider formats, so that I can use a consistent API interface regardless of the underlying provider.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a request is received in standard format THEN the system SHALL transform it to the target provider's format
2. WHEN a response is received from a provider THEN the system SHALL transform it back to the standard format
3. WHEN provider-specific features are used THEN the system SHALL handle feature mapping or graceful degradation
4. IF transformation fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages with details
